# Women Who Code Python Code Challenges

[Women Who Code Days of Code](https://app.hopin.com/events/wwcode-days-of-code/reception) is a women-centered coding event taking place starting January 8, 2024. The 60-Day Python Coding challenge, presents a new Python coding challenge each day from January 10, 2024 - March 10, 2024.
