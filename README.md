# Women Who Code Python Code Challenges

[Women Who Code Days of Code](https://app.hopin.com/events/wwcode-days-of-code/reception) is a women-centered coding event taking place starting January 8, 2024. The 60-Day Python Coding challenge, presents a new Python coding challenge each day from January 10, 2024 - March 10, 2024. By participating in the challenge, participants increase their coding skills and connect with one another in a male-dominated field. 

This repository hosts my solutions to the daily code challenges while participating in the 60-day Python Challenge.
